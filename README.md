The city of Chicago has recently released information about its employees, such as: employee names, salaries, and position titles [link](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Current-Employee-Names-Salaries-and-Position-Title/xzkq-xp2w/data).

Some of the questions I was intereste in are:
- Which department hires the highest number of employees? 
- Who work as full vs. part-time for the city?
- Get some insights on the police department in Chicago

You can access my analysis [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mallaham/City-of-Chicago-Salaries/blob/master/government%20salaries%20in%20chicago.ipynb)
